The sample application given here is a very simple demonstration on how to use the
FN_Sender and FN_Receiver objects.

Possible Usages:
./Notify_App sender <port number>
./Notify_App receiver <ip address> <port>

The sample Notify_App may be used as either a sender or receiver.  To perform
a test using the app, start a sender giving it the port number you wish to 
listen on as an arguement.  Then start one or more receivers giving them the
ip address and the port of the machine you started the server on.

Once the receivers have connected to the server begin typing in fake file
paths into the console the sender was started on.  The file paths will
be displayed by all of the receivers that connected to the sender. When you
are finished typing in files paths type 'quit' to shutdown the server and
the clients.
