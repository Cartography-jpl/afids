Vicar Program "qswp2005"
.HELP
PURPOSE:
"qswp2005" accepts an input dataset that has been fourier transformed
and requires the quadrants to be swapped.  It also has the option to
reverse the swap with "REVERSE" keyword.

EXECUTION:

	qswp2005 INP OUT OP

where:  INP  is the input FFT or matrix of FFTs.
	OUT  is the output file.
        OP   is a keyword that tells whether the dataset has
             already been swapped or not.

OPERATION:
"qswp2005" performs the operation shown in the following diagrams.
The letters A,B,C,D refer to fft quadrants.

WARNING:  Program "qswp2005" perfroms its operation by reading each
FFT entirely into memory.  If its size is large, then it may run very
slowly!

EXAMPLES

	qswp2005 INP=A OUT=B OP=FORWARD

        This command will cause the program to take in the input
        dataset A swap the quadrants and output the result into
        B.  The FORWARD tells the program that the quadrants in
        the input dataset has not been swapped yet.

	qswp2005 INP=A OUT=B OP=REVERSE

        This command will cause the program to take in the input
        dataset A swap the quadrants and output the result into
        B.  The REVERSE tells the program that the quadrants in
        the input dataset has been swapped previously.

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input dataset
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output dataset
.VARIABLE OP
STRING - Specifies forward or reverse swapping
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input fft file - maybe any type of file
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output file - has the same format as the input file
.VARIABLE OP
STRING - Specifies forward or reverse swapping.  If "FORWARD",
         this tells the program that the quadrants in the input
         dataset HAS NOT been swapped.  If "REVERSE", this
         tells the program that the quadrants in the input
         dataset HAS been swapped.
