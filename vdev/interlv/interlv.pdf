vicar program interlv - shift odd and even lines of an image
.help
PURPOSE

Interlv is a simple program which can be used to correct interleave problems 
due to the video capture of an image.  Alternating lines of all or part 
of an image can be shifted left or right by any of number of pixels.  Shifting
by zero pixels results in a simple image copy.  


EXECUTION:

   The following is the execution statement format for "interlv":

             INTERLV INP=PIX OUT=OPIX PARAMS

   where INP, OUT, and PARAMS are parameters discussed in their res-
pective parameter sections. 

PARAMETERS

    PIXOFF  - The number of pixels to be offset (shifted), referring
referring to the even numbered lines.  Shifting by zero pixels
 will result in a simple  image copy operation. Only positive 
numbers allowed. Direction of shifting, right or left is controlled
by DIRCTION parameter

    DIRCTION - The direction of pixels to be offset (shifted), either 
to the left or or right and referring only to the even numbered lines.
The default is to shift to the left.


RESTRICTIONS

As this is intended for video capture using interlaced cameras
The internals are limited to arrays of 1024x1024.

FORMATS byte, half, full and real are supported.

HISTORY

COGNIZANT PROGRAMMER:  R. J. Bambery

REVISIONS:  
        
        18 Dec 1988   ...RJB... INITIAL RELEASE ON VAX/VMS
        02 Dec 2012   ...RJB... Converted to Linux 64-bit using
                                gfortran 4.6.3
                                Removed a number of parameters
                                associated with unlabeled images
                                and tape access. Use label-create instead. 
        15 Sep 2013   ...RJB... Remove interpolate option
                                Increased filename sizes to 100 characters
.level1
.variable inp
Input filename
.variable out
Output filename
.variable size
Window into input
.variable pixoff 
Number of pixels 
to be offset
.variable dirction
Either left or right
.level2
.variable inp
Name of a single input file.
.variable out
Name of a single output file.
.variable size
The size parameter determines the boundaries in the input
file form which the interleave is to take place.  It is specified
as (SL,SS,NL,NS), where
	SL is the starting line
	SS is the starting sample
	NL is the number of lines to be interleaved
	NS is the number of samples(pixels) to be interleaved in each line
.variable pixoff 
The number of pixels to be offset (shifted), referring to the even 
numbered lines.  Shifting by zero pixels will result in a simple 
image copy operation.
.variable dirction
The direction of pixels to be offset (shifted), either to the left or 
or right and referring only to the even numbered lines.  The default 
is to shift to the left.
