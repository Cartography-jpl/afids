 PURPOSE:

Program DIFPICA is a quick and dirty program to compare 2
files.  If the files differ in NL, NS, PIXSIZE, FORMAT, or
in data, it will abort.  For a more detailed comparison of
files, use DIFPIC.

 EXECUTION:

The input images may have any VICAR data format: BYTE, HALF, FULL, REAL, DOUB,
or COMP.  Both input images must have the same format.  The data format is taken
from the VICAR label of the first input file.  The optional output 
image has the same data format as the input images.
