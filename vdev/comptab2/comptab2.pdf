comptab2 - tabulate connected components to an IBIS file
.HELP
PURPOSE:
comptab2 is a modified program of comptab

comptab2 creates an IBIS tabular file from a connected component image and
from 0 to 48 registered brightness or difference images.  The connected
component image is a halfword image, usually created by program CONCOMP.
The registered images can be byte or half.  The IBIS tabular file that is 
output has one record for each connected component and the following
columns:

1.  The component number
2.  The count of pixels in the component, can be converted to area
3.  The line number of the first pixel scanned (in l,s order) of the component
4.  The sample number of the first pixel scanned
5.  The diameter in pixels of the component
6.  The line centroid of component
7.  The samp centroid of component
8.  Extra column for future stats
9.  Extra column for future stats
10.  Extra column for future stats
11.  Extra column for future stats
12.  The average brightness or pixel value of the component in the 1st input image
13.  The average brightness or pixel value of the neighborhood of the component
    in the 1st input image
14.  The average brightness or pixel value of the component in the 2d input image
15.  The average brightness or pixel value of the neighborhood of the component
    in the 2d input image
etc

the last 10 columns are set to 0.0 to allow room for user calculation.

If a SIZE parameter is used, it applies to all of the input images.

EXECUTION:

Example

comptab2 INP=(A,B,C) OUT=D  A is the connected component image.  B and C are
                          registered brightness images. D is the output tabular file



OPERATION:

The statistics are read into an array from the input images.  The output
statistics are calculated and then written to an IBIS file.

LIMITATIONS:

Comptab2 does not play nice with compressed images. If you run an older
version of comptab2 (older than the Nov 6, 2017 version) with such an image, 
the program will abort with the message:

[TAE-PRCSTRM] Abnormal process termination; process status code = 11.;

The Nov 6 and later versions will now abort with the message:

??E - One or more of images are compressed
??E - Compressed images are illegal for comptab2
 ** ABEND called **


What was failing internally is the statement:

    status = IBISColumnSet(ibis2,"U_FORMAT","FULL",i+1);

You must uncompress any such input image such as yy with the following

    comprs yy yyuncompr compress="none"

before using comptab2.

A label-list will not show that an image is compressed. However, if the
task list includes something like:

---- Task: COMPRS -- User: rkf -- Mon Sep  8 18:45:16 2008 ----

You can reasonably believe that it is compressed.

You can detect such an image with the following logic inside your script:
    
    lab2tcl yy v1=compress keyword="compress" type="SYSTEM"
    write "&compress"

if &compress = "BASIC" or "BASIC2" the you must uncompress the file 
before using comptab2.

   
 TIMING: 

all algorithms are linear with the image area.

 REVISION HISTORY

11/06/2017 R. Bambery   Fixes to prevent error msg:
     [TAE-PRCSTRM] Abnormal process termination; process status code = 11.;
     Now gracefully exits with message:
        ??E - One or more of images are compressed
        ??E - Compressed images are illegal for comptab
        ** ABEND called **
07/03/2014 W. Bunch   Raised component limit to 10000000
03/02/2009 P. Kim     6 more stat columns added by pkim for centroid and extra stats

.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
STRING - Input image files; 1st
is connected component; others
registered brightness or dif-
ference images
.VARIABLE OUT
STRING - Output IBIS tabulr file
.VARIABLE SIZE
INTEGER - Region of input files
to be concatenated
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples
.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
INP specifies the input data sets.  Up to 48 are allowed.
.VARIABLE SIZE
The SIZE parameter may be used when only a sub-region of each image is to
be concatenated; it has the format SIZE=(SL,SS,NL,NS), where the parameters
are starting line, starting sample, number of lines, and number of samples,
respectively.  SIZE=(1,1,10,10), for example, will cause comptab2 to only look
at the first ten samples of each of the first ten lines in each image, when
performing the concatenation. The default (1,1,0,0) means use the whole image.
.VARIABLE SL
INTEGER - Starting line (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE SS
INTEGER - Starting sample (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NL
INTEGER - Number of lines (see SIZE)
.VARIABLE NS
INTEGER - Number of samples (see SIZE)
.END
