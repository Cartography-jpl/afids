This contains a GUI used to do the immediate ground processing when ARGUS
lands. This includes copying the data needed to process the points of interest
(POI), generating the map projected imagery, and copying the remaining
data.

This software uses the Ruby GTK bindings. These aren't normally installed
with an AFIDS build (as of January 2010), but you can install them by building
the additional target "ruby_gnome".

The file ground_processing.glade contains the description of the GUI. This
can be edited by the program "glade-3", which is installed if you build the
ruby_gnome target. The program "ruby-glade-create-template" is used to create
the file GroundProcessingGlade.rb - there is a small Makefile in the directory
to help with doing that. You should not directly modify 
GroundProcessingGlade.rb since it gets overwritten whenever the 
ground_processing.glade file is modified. Instead, we have the class
GroundProcessingGui which derives from GroundProcessingGlade and overrides 
whatever functions we are changing.

There is a small wrapper script argus_ground_processing which sets up the 
environment and runs the
