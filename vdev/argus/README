Note, these scripts aren't currently maintained. We don't use or support
Ruby any longer, so if we end up needing to dust these off we'll want to
replace all this with python code.

These are the set of scripts used to process ARGUS data.

There are two sets of scripts. The "GroundProcessing" is a set that is used
in the field. This gives a GUI interface that allows the user to quickly
process images for selected POIs.

The second set of scripts are for working with at JPL. This is done after
the campaign, and allow us to do camera calibration, generation of high
resolution images, and mosaics. There are two interfaces. The class Argus
defined in argus.rb gives a general class that can be used to do a range
of things in a scripting environment. In addition, there are set of scripts
for doing the canned procedures that we do for generating mosaics. These
are driven by a Makefile (which gives a simple way to run jobs in parallel
by using the -j <num process> options).

We have a standard directory structure. This is set up by the 
GroundProcessing scripts, and is the structure we expect input to be sent
to JPL. The output of the ground processing is in placed in the directory
"GroundProcessed" and "POI".

The JPL processing is put into "JplProcessed" and "Mosaic".

We have a script "setup_jpl_directory.rb" which sets up the the directory,
this just copies some standard files there and sets up for running.

Note that there a are *two* camera configuration files. There is the
file "Configuration/camera.yml". This is what was used for Ground Processing.
It is our best guess at the camera values without actually doing a calibration
(usually just the results of the last campaigns camera calibration). There
is a second set generated in "JplProcessed/camera_calibrated.yml". This
is what is generated by camera calibration.
