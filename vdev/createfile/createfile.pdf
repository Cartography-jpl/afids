.TITLE
TAE proc to create an empty file
.help
PURPOSE:

CREATEFILE creates an empty file with the specified name.

EXECUTION:
 This utility can be called from a VICAR procedure using the syntax:

 createfile filename 

 where filename is the name to be given to the empty file created.

 This command is normally used to create an ascii text file within
 a vicar procedurei in cases where certain processing steps provide
 output that needs to go into a table. Most commonly it is used
 to create a list of file names or items that are an output from
 a series of files.

 To add items to the created empty file, use add2file.
