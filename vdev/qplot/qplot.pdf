QPLOT - TAE procedure to plot the DN values along a specified straighti
         line through an image
.HELP
Purpose:  QPLOT calls QPLOT2 to plot the DN values along a specified straight 
  line through an image. It also does spectral plots for multi-channel data. 
  The plot will be displayed on the terminal unless the parameter PLOTFMT=eps
  is specified, in which case QPLOT2 generates a PostScipt output file.

 
  This procedure call was created to do only the PROCESS portion of the
  QPLOT2 functions, that is, the line profile function. The SPROCESS
  function is normally done by calling QPLOT2 directly.


Parameters:  There are two types of parameters: 

      (1) Parameters with a single specification:
        INP             OUT             NCHAN
		TITLE	        LOTITLE	        XTITLE
		YTITLE          LABELSIZ        LOLABEL
		NORM            RDS             DISPLACE
		XLENGTH         YLENGTH         TICS
		XSCALE          YSCALE
      (2) Parameters which have a specification for each line plotted:
		PROCESS         SPROCESS
		XVALUES         YVALUES

Restrictions:
  (1) Maximum number of lines plotted is 10.
  (2) Maximum x axis length is 18 inches. 
  (3) Maximum y axis length is 12 inches.
  (4) Cannot use PROCESS and SPROCESS parameters simultaneously
  (5) Multi Band BSQ (MSS) files are not supported via the QPLOT procedure


NOTES:

  The common plotting routines used in MIPL were removed in this version
  and converted to gnuplot commands. The Mipl version in 2011 uses the
  xrt commercial plotting package.


OUTPUTS:

  Up to two types of outputs can be produced, interactive plots using
  gnuplot and hardcopy plots suitable for publications using gnuplot and ghostscript
  or gimp.

  The first type of plot is rendered via the creation of a gnuplot instruction, or
  command file. This is indicated by the file extension of .gpi.  After completion
  of the qplot task this file creates an interactive plot on the desktop, e.g.,
     ush gnuplot qplot.gpi.
  This display stays active until mouse-clicked somewhere on the plot panel.
  The terminal window prompt is inactive until the panel is closed.

  If you wish, you can issue the following gnuplot command to keep the plot on
  the desktop.

  ush gnuplot -persist gplot.gpi

  Again the terminal prompt is inactive until the plot panel has been mouse-clicked.
  After the mouse click the panel remains but the terminal prompt is restored. This
  makes it easy to compare outputs from several qplot commands.

  A second output is derived from the PLOTFMT parameter. By default this parameter is
  set to "---" so no hardcopy output is produced.  This is equivalent to
  setting it to PLOTFMT=GNUPLOT. It can be set to "EPS" in which
  case a file called qplot.eps.gpi is created. If you issue the command

  ush gnuplot qplot.eps.gpi

  no interactive plot panel is created but it produces a file qplot.eps. This
  file can be displayed using ghostscript (the usual unix command is gs).

  gs qplot.eps

  or gimp, e.g.,

  gimp qplot.eps

  PLOTOUT can also be given a file name, e.g.,
  PLOTOUT=fourbands   (not necessary to give file extension)

  In that case it will produce a file named fourbands.gpi.

Revision: One - 15 April 1984
          Two - 14 November 1988

      7-Nov-1995  - Florance Moss - Made portable to UNIX
      23-Aug-2006 -lwk- since default for Unix is now different from VMS, disabled
	             latter option (VMS no longer being supported);  replaced NOPRINT 
	             with NODISP (apparently the behaviour of the XRTPS software has 
	             changed!)
      2013-08-21 - Ray Bambery - fixes for AFIDS - Made compatible with qplot2
                parameters and the gnuplot plotting package. Removed xrt software calls.
                which are not used in the Cartlab.
      2013-08-28 - Ray Bambery - Added NOLABEL parameter to be compatible with change
                to QPLOT2 to prevent problems with long labels. It can corrupt the
                gnuplot script which will give an error like "line 54: invalid expression"
                on entering the command gnuplot xx.gpi

.level2
.variable inp
Input data set; maximum number is 10.
.variable out
Output plot file; This is the output plot file which can be printed on a
printer using (on Unix) the lpr command.   Note that this postscript file 
will always be created, but it will be empty unless NODISP is specified.
(QPLOT.PSF is the default output file name).
.variable process
Specifies one or more lines to be plotted. Following the keyword,
each plot is specified by a set of five numbers. The first value 
in each set specifies the Input Data Set Number and  the remaining four
values specify the Starting Line, Starting Sample, Ending Line, and 
Ending Sample. (No Default).  NOTE:  The line plotted will cover
SQRT((EL-SL)**2+(ES-SS)**2) "relative samples" along the horizontal axis and
will start at "relative sample" 1.
.variable nchan
Specifies the number of spectral channels in an input data set in mss
format. This keyword is used in conjunction with the SPROCESS keyword.
(Default is 1)
.variable sprocess
Specifies one or more spectral plots. This keyword requires that the input 
be in mss format and that NCHAN is specified. Following the keyword,
each spectral plot is specified by a set of two numbers. The first value
in each set specifies the Line and the second value the Sample of the
point within the first channel through which the spectral plot is to be
done. (No Default)
.variable title
Used to specify the title of plots (Max length of 52 characters).
(Default is 'IPL LINE PLOT', or for spectral plots, 'IPL SPECTRAL PLOT')
.variable lotitle
Specifies that the title will be written within the 8.5 x 11 area
(if the y axis length is less than or equal to 7 inches). (Default
is to place the title at the top of the page)
.variable xtitle
Specifies the title for the X axis (Max length of 52 characters). (Default is
'Relative Sample Number')
.variable ytitle
Specifies the title for the Y axis (Max length of 52 characters). (Default is
'DN Value')
.variable labelsiz
Specifies the height in inches of the label characters. For a value
of 0.0, no labels are printed. (Default is 0.12)
.variable lolabel
Specifies that labels will be written within the 8.5 x 11 space.
(Default is to place the labels at the top of the page.)
.variable norm
Causes DN values to be scaled linearly so that the largest value
becomes 1.  The length of the y axis is set to 5 inches.
(Default is that this is not done.)
.variable rds
Causes DN values to be scaled by the following equation:
OUT=SQRT(IN**2-RDS**2). (Default is that this is not done)
.variable displace
Specifies that subsequent lines on the same plot will be displaced
by the given amount.  This is specified in terms of the final plotted
vertical values, rather than input DN, in the cases where the input
values are scaled. (Default is 0.0)
.variable xlength
Specifies the length in inches of the X axis. (Default is 9.0; Max is 72.0)
.variable ylength
Specifies the length in inches of the Y axis. (Default is 7.0; max is 12.0)
.variable xscale
Specifies the scale used along the X axis.  The X axis will be drawn going
from a minimum of the first value to a maximum of the second.  The defaults
for these values are obtained by determining the minimum and maximum X 
values to be plotted on the axis and then passing these values to the
subroutine SCALE.
SCALE determines the scaling so that 1 inch along the axis will always be
an interval of 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 8*(10**n) units.  This usually results in 
having the plotted lines occupy only a portion of the axis.  By using the 
XSCALE keyword the user can force plots to occupy a greater portion of the 
X axis.  Axis values are printed every inch, however, and if it is desired
that these values be nice round numbers the quantity:
                  (XSCALEMAX-XSCALEMIN)/XLENGTH 
should be a nice round number.
.variable yscale
Specifies the scale used along the Y axis.  The Y axis will be drawn going
from a minimum of the first value to a maximum of the second.  The defaults
for these values are obtained by determining the minimum and maximum Y 
values to be plotted on the axis and then passing these values to the
subroutine SCALE.
SCALE determines the scaling so that 1 inch along the axis will always be
an interval of 1,2,3,4,5,6 or 8*(10**n) units.  This usually results in

that these values be nice round numbers the quantity:
                  (YSCALEMAX-YSCALEMIN)/YLENGTH 
should be a nice round number.
.variable xvalues
Allows the user to rescale the actual x (sample) data values of the 
lines to be plotted. XVALUES is followed by sets of two real values, one
set for each line to be plotted. The two values in each set specify the
minimum and maximum x values. The first value (the minimum) is the point
along the X axis where the first data point will be plotted.  The second
value (the maximum) is the point along the X axis where the last data
point will be plotted.
(DEFAULTS: XMIN=1.0, XMAX=SQRT[(EL-SL)**2+(ES-SS)**2]+1
.variable yvalues
Allows the user to rescale the actual y (DN) data values of the 
lines to be plotted. YVALUES is followed by sets of two real values, one
set for each line to be plotted. The two values in each set specify the
minimum and maximum y values. The first value (the minimum) is the point
along the Y axis where a DN of zero will be plotted.  The second value
(the maximum) is the point along the Y axis where a DN of 255 (32767 for
halfword data) will be plotted.
(DEFAULT: YMIN=0.0, YMAX=255 (byte) YMAX=32767 (halfword)   )
