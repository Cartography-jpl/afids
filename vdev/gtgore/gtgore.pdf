.TITLE
GTGORE - special purpose program to calculate gores for gtwarpxd.
.HELP
PURPOSE
     GTGORE is a VICAR applications program which calculates gore
     adjustments for GTWARPXD (see its subroutine GTWRPSUB).  It
     is not intended for general use.
	   
CALL
     gtgore (GRID_A,GRID_B) ACOLS=(C1,C2,C3,C4) BCOLS=(C1,C2,C3,C4) +
           SLVAR=INCSL SSVAR=INCSS NLVAR=INCNL NSVAR=INCNS
  WHERE:
     GRID_A         is the first grid in GEOMV format.
     GRID_B         is the second grid in GEOMV format.
     ACOLS          are the columns used in the first ibis file.
     BCOLS          are the columns used in the second ibis file.
     SLVAR          is a TAE TCL variable to output the SL increment
     SSVAR          is a TAE TCL variable to output the SS increment
     NLVAR          is a TAE TCL variable to output the NL increment
     NSVAR          is a TAE TCL variable to output the NS increment
     
OPERATION

GTGORE operates like gridcomp except that.

PERFORMANCE

faster than gridcomp

Restrictions
------------

Only a 40 x 40 grid can be input as the second file.  The first file must
be in GEOMV input format.  Both input files are IBIS files.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE ACOLS
    ACOLS=(C1,C2,C3,C4)  Columns in the first IBIS tabular file that
			 contain the tiepoints.  C1 has new line,
			 C2 has new sample, C3 has old line, and
			 C4 has old sample.  The defaults are
			 (1,2,3,4).
.VARIABLE BCOLS
    BCOLS=(C5,C6,C7,C8)  Columns in the second IBIS tabular file that
			 contain the tiepoints.  C5 has new line,
			 C6 has new sample, C7 has old line, and
			 C8 has old sample.  The defaults are
			 (1,2,3,4).
