VICAR program spot2ortho - directly orthorectifies SPOT image file to VICAR
.help
PURPOSE

    This directly orthorectifies a SPOT dimap file to a set of 
    orthorectified images, using the SRTM DEM or other DEM file

    This generates a series out output files, one per band. You
    can either supply a base basename to use, in which case we
    add a "_b1.img", "_b2.img", etc to the basename, or if you
    prefer you can supply a list of output names to use.

    You can supply a DEM file to use to supply the elevation data.
    If you don't supply a DEM, we use the SRTM.

    1.  The keyword 'coverinp causes the procedure to map all of the
    input image to an output image that will just contain it.   The
    keyword gorewid allows the user to specify a zero-filled margin
    to make the output a little larger.
	
    2.  The keyword 'coverref causes the procedure to map the input
    image to an output image that exactly matches the "reference" image.
    Some parts of the input can be lost, or huge areas of zero-fill
    could be added to make the images match.  The gorewid keyword has
    no effect in this case.

    You only need to supply a reference image for 'coverref, this isn't
    needed for 'coverinp

CALL

    spot2vicar inp outbase (ref) '(qualifiers) (param)
    spot2vicar inp out=(f1,f2,f3,f4) (ref) '(qualifiers) (param)
   WHERE:
      inp     is the input DIMAP file
      outbase is the basename to use for the output file    
      out     it the explicit list of output files to use
      ref     is the reference image, only needed for 'coverref
      QUALIFIERS consist of any of the following keywords:
          COVERINP smallest output that covers the input geographic area
          COVERREF output exactly matches the reference image.
      gorewid optional whitespace to add for 'coverinp
      gridspacing Number of pixels between exact calculation of IPI

OPERATION

This directly uses the geometry and camera information supplied in
the SPOT DIMAP file to orthorectify the data.
