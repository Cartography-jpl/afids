.LEVEL1
.VARIABLE INP
This variable specifies
the files to concatenate.
There must be 2 .slp files
to concatenate whereas
the 2 .dlp files are
optional.  The .slp files
must be listed before the
".dlp" files.

.VARIABLE OUT
This variable specifies
the output files.
If only the .slp files
were specified in the
input, then only the
".slp" output file needs
to be specified.  If both
".slp" and .dlp files were
specified in the input
variable then both .slp 
and .dlp output files 
should be specified. The 
".slp" file must be specified 
before the .dlp file.

.LEVEL2
.VARIABLE INP
For example:
to concatenate lake1.slp
and lake2.slp - 
inp=(lake1.slp, lake2.slp)
to concatenate their
corresponding .dlp files
inp=(lake1.slp, lake2.slp,
lake1.dlp, lake2.dlp)

.VARIABLE OUT
For example:
if only .slp files were
specified in inp, then -
out=(output.slp)
if both .slp and .dlp
files were specified
in inp, then -
out=(output.slp, output.dlp)

.END
