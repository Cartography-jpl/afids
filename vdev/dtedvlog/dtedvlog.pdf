dtedvlog - converts a DMA DTED file to VICAR
.HELP
PURPOSE:

The source DMA files are the standard files as they come on CD-ROM.
This program converts the data to VICAR.  A GeoTIFF label can be
added with GTGEN.  This should always be done with a proc so that 
mistakes will not occur.  See the procedure DTEDLOG.PDF.

EXECUTION:

Example

dtedvlog INP=A OUT=B LON=lon LAT=lat HEMI1=w HEMI2=n

OPERATION:

The DMA DTED file can be on a CDROM or can be copied to a disk
file with the FILE MANAGER or the unix dd command.

It seems that the headers were of different sizes for the different 
generations of DMA DTED, so the program reads the header to a
characteristic set of four zero words, then starts reading the data.

Other assumptions:

1.  Files between 50 degrees north and 50 degrees south are 1201 by
1201.  50 degrees and beyond are 1201 by 601.  The label is not
checked for this, though this could be added to the program.

2.  There are 5 halfword pixels between each line.

3.  The level 1 file input name must end with .dt1, level 2 is .dt2

 TIMING: 

About 3 seconds on a SPARCstation.
