.TITLE
ibis2asc - turn IBIS columns into text file columns with no extraneous text
.HELP
PURPOSE
   The user can choose which columns to write to the ascii file and the starting
   record and number of records.  The columns are separated by blanks by default
   but the user can choose another separator such as comma.

   The quote keyword causes strings to be enclosed in double quotes.

   The program will write a blank for any value within .1% of the penupval.
   This provides for passing penup commands to the plot package.
CALL
     ibis2asc INP OUT COLS=(C1,C2,C3,...) SR=I1 NR=I2
  WHERE:
     INP          is an ibis file
     OUT          is an ascii file with selected data printed in columns
     COLS         are the columns in the INP file to be printed
     SR           is the starting record to print
     NR           is the number of records to print
