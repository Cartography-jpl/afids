PURPOSE
    A vicar application program to provide the first derivative of an
image.

OPERATION

    This program takes an input data set and converts it to its first derivative
in either the Horizontal (sample) orientation or the Vertical (line) orientation.
The second output is the inflection map, where 0 is no inflection, +1 is inflection
going from pos to negative and -1 is inflection going from negative to postive,

The parmeter orient gives the orientation of the derivative.

The return parameters give the numnber of positive and negative inflection points
in the map

RESTRICTIONS

    1) This program does not preserve Map Projection label geometry.
    2) This program does not work on multiband images
