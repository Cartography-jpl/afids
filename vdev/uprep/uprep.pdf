PURPOSE
 This program was developed specifically for
 the SHIVA project.  It creates training
 samples using the output from stats or ustats
 program.  The inputs are the image files
 that were input into the stats or ustats
 program and the ibis statistics file that
 was output from the stat or ustat program.
 The output is an ibis file where samples
 were chosen from the image using stratified
 sampling and are classified into the
 class as specified by the input statistics
 file.  The sampled pixel x is classified
 into the class with the smallest Mahalanobis
 distance.

 The output is an IBIS file that contains
 the class name, line, sample, and the
 dn values.  For example, if there are
 3 image input files then the output
 file would have the format:

 col      data
 ===      ====
  1       class name
  2       line
  3       sample
  4       dn from image 1
  5       dn from image 2
  6       dn from image 3
