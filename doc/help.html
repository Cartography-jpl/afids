<p><b>AFIDS Image Co-Registration System (v4.0p; 26JUN2007):</b></p>

<p><b>HOW TO Coregister and Map Project Multidate ALI,
Aster, Hyperion, Ikonos,
Landsat, MODIS, NTM, SPOT, and Quickbird Imagery</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">,
with no manual tiepoint selection, and only one resampling. Note that
not every
image is a good candidate for coregistration because of clouds, smoke,
haze,
dramatic change (e.g., agricultural fields; seasonal foliage; land
surface
destruction; water fluctuations; temporal forest or urban
expansion/contraction), image quality, resolution, off-nadir viewing,
and/or
other image scene changing events. This Automated Fusion of Image Data
System
(AFIDS) software package was developed at the NASA/Caltech/Jet
Propulsion
Laboratory in the Cartographic Applications Laboratory (Section 386).

224 (of 242) spectral channels (0.43 to 2.4um). </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Aster Level 1B
(and 1A) Imagery in HDF (.hdf or no suffix). The Aster metadata file is
not required. Aster bands 1, 2, and 3N are 15m visual wavelengths;
bands 4-9 are 30m shortwave; and bands 10-14 are 90m thermal infrared.
ONLY Aster imagery taken during the day can be registered (night data
is not supported). Use of Level 1B imagery (versus 1A) is strongly
recommended. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">MODIS MOD021KM
(1km) spectral imagery and MOD03 (Geophysical metadata) in HDF format
(.hdf and .hdf.met). The input can be either daytime or nighttime
imagery, but only day-to-day or night-to-night imagery can be
registered (no day/night registration). The registered output imagery
is usually either UTM or Platte Carree map projection, but the UTM
projection may cross two or more zones due to the large geographic
extent of the MODIS imagery. Only MOD021KM Level-1B (1km) imagery
containing 38 bands are currently supported. MODIS band wavelengths
range from 0.64 to 14.24um. All bands are output at 1km resolution. </li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>&nbsp;
AOI - Gather Lat/Long coordinates describing your image Area Of
Interest.</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
Review your satellite image's Metadata to obtain Latitude and Longitude
coordinates completely surrounding your imagery's geographic area. Also
note your particular subarea AOI coordinates (if different from the
whole image). You will need to expand the whole-image coordinates for
specifying the DEM, and CIB or Landsat mosaic dimensions. For NITF
imagery, this information can be obtained using AFIDS as mentioned in
STEP 1. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><span style="color: black;"><b>&nbsp; Landsat/CIB -
Obtain Orthorectified Landsat OR CIB Compressed Image Base data that
completely covers your image's geographic area</b></span><span style="color: black;">. (Skip this step if you have the JPL
Landsat database <i>and</i></span><span style="color: black;"> are registering Hyperion, ALI, Aster,
or other Landsat imagery.) AFIDS requires either a Landsat or CIB image
base to impart map projection characteristics during the coregistration
process. Choose either CIB or Landsat data, but NOT both. The Landsat
data is required for Hyperion, ALI, and Landsat coregistration tasks,
and is also the best choice for Aster data. Choose CIB for Ikonos,
&nbsp;Quickbird,&nbspSPOT and NTM. MODIS does NOT require an image base
file. For a Landsat image base, obtain orthorectified Landsat 4, 5, or
7 data in UTM map projection and TIFF format (See Users Guide). Up to
four Landsat images can be mosaicked at one time, or extract an area
from the AFIDS/Landsat World Database file (if available; See the Users
Guide).&nbsp; For a CIB image base, obtain Compressed Image Base 1
or 5-meter CDROMs. The CIB CDROMs can be used directly or copied to a
hard disk. The CIB CDROM should completely cover the image's geographic
area, but keep the area small, as the file size can quickly become very
large. Data from up to four CIB CDROMs can be accessed for one mosaic.
CIB 10-meter resolution data are not currently supported. If reading
from the CDROM, be sure to put it in the computer's CDROM tray. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>&nbsp;
DEM - Obtain Digital Elevation Model (DEM) "DTED" CDROMs completely
covering the image area, or use the AFIDS/SRTM L2 World DEM database </b><span style="font-weight: normal;">(if available; See Users
Guide). DEM data is used to correct for topographic relief displacement
during the coregistration process. The DTED CDROMs can be used
directly, or the CD<span style="color: black;">'</span>s
DEM files can be copied to a hard disk. If copied to disk, be sure to
preserve the DTED directory structure (e.g.,
~/dtedraw/dted/e042/34.dt1; Longitudes always have 3 digits) and use
LOWER CASE characters. If the image<span style="color: black;">'</span>s
geographic area crosses a DTED CDROM boundary, the data from both
CDROMs must be copied to disk. Both DTED Level 1 and Level 2 are
supported. Up to 30 DEM cells can be mosaicked at a time. If reading
from the CDROM, be sure to put it in the computer<span style="color: black;">'</span>s CDROM tray. DTED data
is NOT used by MODIS (use the provided "~/data/vdev/etop02nobath.hlf"
two-minute DEM). </span></li>

<p><a name="step2"><b>STEP 2: IMAGE MOSAIC
GENERATION</b></a><span style=""></span>
- <span style="color: black;">This step
creates two mosaic files that are used internally to correct map
projection and
topographic relief displacement errors. The two DEM options are used to
create
a dtedmos file for all imagery selections except MODIS. The two Landsat
options
are used to create a basemos file for ALI, Aster, Hyperion, and Landsat
imagery
selections. The CIB option is used to create a basemos file for the
remaining
Ikonos, Quickbird, SPOT and NTM imagery selections. For this Step 2, you
must create
both dtedmos and basemos files (as identified above). Create a DTED DEM
(Digital Elevation Model) mosaic, CIB (Controlled Image Base 1 or
5-meter)
mosaic, and/or Landsat mosaic file, by selecting the appropriate Step 2
button
followed by the Setup button, to begin the data preparation process. To
use
either of the AFIDS. options, you must have the JPL-prepared global
bases.
Otherwise, you must have access to individual DTED-1, Landsat UTM Band
3 files,
and/or CIB 1 or 5 meter cdrom datasets. Note, for Quickbird and NTM
images in
NITF format with rpcs, a CIB image base is recommended but not
required. If not
provided, the user will be required to enter a Latitude/Longitude

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Grid
Fineness:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
These values define the grid used by the (internal) automated tiepoint
selection and matching routines. The default values have been optimized
for each particular image type. Increase these values if the
registration results are unsatisfactory, or images are over
15000x15000. Generally, (Horz*Vert)&lt;1,000,000 preferred;
&lt;4,000,000 maximum (2000x2000 grid).</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Output
Pixel Size</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
(Ikonos/Quickbird only): The default is the nominal panchromatic pixel
size (Ikonos = 1.0; Quickbird = 0.61). The multispectral sizes are
Ikonos = 4.0m and Quickbird = 2.44m.</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Output
Map Projection:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
For all image types, choose Platte Carree (geographic; rectangular) or
UTM output map projection, or provide your own Reference (target) map
projection. Use the browse button to find your own existing AFIDS or
external GeoTIFF target reference image. If the GeoTIFF file is from an
external source, only the following projections are currently
supported: Platte Carree, UTM, Albers Equal Area, and Lambert Conformal
Conic with two standard parallels. Note that the large area coverage of
MODIS images can cause projection problems in the far northern and
southern latitudes (use the AOI Selection option, above, to remove
extreme latitudes from the imagery).</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Resample
Method:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Use
the default 'Bilinear' interpolation for the best pixel matching and
smooth pixel transitions. Use 'Nearest Neighbor' to preserve pixel
values, but with up to half-pixel offsets.</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Raster
Type:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Use
'Area' to have the origin (0,0) in the upper left corner of the pixel.
Use 'Point' for the origin to be placed in the center of the pixel.
Generally, 'Area' is used for images and 'Point' is used for DEMs and
other map-like raster products. This option is overruled if the 'Output
Map Projection/Reference' option (above) is specified. This option can
be helpful for georeference compatibility with commercially-generated
imagery.</span></li>

to manually find two or three tiepoints for guiding the automated FFT
tiepoint process. This option is especially necessary if the Hyperion
ACS metadata file is missing or damaged. After clicking the 'Choose

default is recommended. Click 'Reference' if the input image is to be
trimmed to match the dimensions of the Reference image (second input).
Click 'Input' to retain all the input image's area, but note that this
option may result in an output image of different size and starting
position than the reference image. The default is 'Reference'. 'Gore
Width' is the number of black pixels added to pad the input image when
output. </span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Interpolation:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Choose the interpolation
method. The default is recommended. 'Bilinear' splits and resamples
pixels, but gives a precise pixel-to-pixel fit. 'Nearest Neighbor'
preserves pixel integrity by duplicating or removing pixels, but often
produces half-pixel offsets.</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Poly
Fit:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The
default is recommended. Choose the desired polynomial fit. The default
is Piecewise Linear. Options include: Linear, Keystone, Quadratic, and
Cubic. </span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Initial
FFT Window Size:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
The default is recommended. Increase this number if the initial output
image registration quality is poor. Valid numbers are: 32, 64, 128,
256, 512, and 1024. The default is 64.</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>FFT
Footprint Zoom:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
The default is recommended. Increase this number if the output image
registration quality is poor, and adjusting the "Initial FFT Window
Size" parameter hasn't helped. This parameter expands the area under
which the FFT will be calculated by "leap frogging" pixels. Small
numbers (1-10) are best, if you need to change the default. Should only
be used with images that are two meter resolution or better. </span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Correlation
Tolerance:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
The default is recommended. This parameter controls which tiepoints are
used in the resampling process. Lowering the Tolerance will increase
the number of lower-quality tiepoints. Raising the Tolerance will
decrease the total number of tiepoints, but the remaining tiepoints
will be of very high quality. Adjust this parameter only if you are
having problems obtaining a good registration.</span></li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style=""><b>Grid
Fineness:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
These values define the grid used by the automated tiepoint selection
and matching routines. 500x500 or 1200x1200 are good choices over the
default, but they will increase the processing time. Generally, Horz *
Vert should be less than 1,000,000.</span></li>

<p><a name="rid"><b>Registered Image
Difference (RID) Connected Component
Analysis</b></a><span style=""></span> -
The purpose of this
utility is to create a visual color-coded mask of the 'change
detection' (image
subtraction) between two image dates, using spectral thresholds and
custom
filters to focus on the specific characteristics of a desired target
pixel set.
This approach will work for all AFIDS-supported sensor types where two
images
have been co-registered (NTM, Quickbird, SPOT, Aster, Landsat, etc.). To
start this
process, select "RID Connected Component Analysis" from the Utilities
Menu and click the "Setup" button to display the RID dialog box.</p>

<p>The RID process has two phases: 1) "Filter Design," which
involves
stepwise iteration of values and the viewing of results, and 2) "Filter
Use," which is the repeated application of pre-defined filters in a
production environment. The "Filter Design" phase and process is
described below in a series of steps:</p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>-</span><span style='font-size: 7pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Step 1, Input Images:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> Use the
"Browse" buttons to locate the two co-registered images that are to
be analyzed.&nbsp; Any AFIDS-registered images can be selected. For
consistency, the first image should be the oldest date, and the second
image
should be the newest date. You should also know the location in the
image of
one or more target(s) of interest that you want to search for elsewhere
in the
image.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>-</span><span style='font-size: 7pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Step 2, Filter Files:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The
"Save Filter" box is for saving your RID parameters. The "Reload
Filter" box is for retrieving a saved RID parameter file. Use the
"Browse" buttons to locate a directory to save or retrieve the
parameter file. The ".flt" suffix MUST be entered as part of the file
name. Be sure to click the "Save" button to actually save your
parameter file. A reloaded parameter file must be re-entered into the
save box
for it to be resaved after modification.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-family: "Times New Roman";'>-</span><span style='font-size: 7pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Step 3, Tools:</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> The options
specified in the "Tools" box provide a methodology for filling in the
remaining "Thresholds," "Filters," and "Spectral
Filters" dialog boxes. Perform each of these tool options in order,
from
top to bottom. Be sure to click "OK" when the "Job Ended"
dialog box appears.</span></p>

<ul type="disc">

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Display
Input Images"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
then click the "Start" button. This will bring up two xvd display
windows showing the two input images. These images are for reference
and information. Reposition the displays on the monitor screen so they
are available for subsequent review, but don't cover the RID dialog box
OR the xterm window. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Input
Histograms"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
then click the "Start" button.&nbsp; This step will generate
frequency histograms of the two input images and report them in the
xterm window (scroll back for review). These histograms are primarily
for reference and information. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Equalized
Histograms"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
then click the "Start" button. Three equalized histograms will appear
in the xterm window for: 1) The first Image; 2) The second Image
(histogram-matched to the first Image); and 3) The difference image (of
the two equalized images). For change detection, the primary interest
is in the tails of the difference image, where the maximum "Plus" and
"Minus" change has occurred between the two images. </span>
    <ul type="circle">

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Choose
"cut-off" points from the (difference image) tails, and enter these
values into the "Plus" and "Minus" boxes located in the "Thresholds"
dialog box. The "Plus" cut-off point (pixel value) indicates the lowest
"bright" pixel of "changed" interest. All the values greater than the
"Plus" value will be considered in the subsequent processing.
Correspondingly, the "Minus" cut-off point indicates the highest "dark"
pixel of interest. These first "guesses" can be iterated upon later. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">If the
difference image has a large spike at its "negative" end, there may be
some shadow, gore, water, or other dark featues in the imagery.
Optionally, select a pixel value that cuts off the spike, and enter
this pixel value in the "Shadow" box located in the "Threshold" dialog
box. All the image pixels below this threshold will be excluded from
analysis. This first "guess" can also be iterated upon later. </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Plus/Minus
Components"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
then click the "Start" button. This step generates "Plus" and "Minus"
image masks (0/1) and uses xvd to display them showing those areas that
are above (plus) and below (minus) the specified thresholds. As
displayed, "Light" pixels are light pixels in Image 1 and dark pixels
in Image 2. "Dark" pixels are light pixels in Image 2 and dark pixels
in Image 1. </span>
    <ul type="circle">

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">These initial
black and white displays are for review purposes. If one of the Plus or
Minus displays is NOT picking up your known target location, then you
should modify (broaden/lower) the Plus, Minus, and Shadow threshold
values. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Alternatively,
if one of the displays IS picking up your target, but is also selecting
a lot of other unrelated pixels (noise) and objects are starting to
coalesce, then you need to tighten/raise the thresholds. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">This process
can be iterated as many times as desired, but be SURE to click the
"Start" button (at the bottom of the RID dialog box) after changing the
thresholds, to make the new values effective. </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Component
Numbers"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> then
click the "Start" button. This step assigns a unique number to every
separate pixel group ("cluster" or "polygon") found in the imagery. To
ensure that every light and dark pixel group is visually displayable,
the number one (1) million is added to all the dark (Minus) pixel
groups, and the number two (2) million is added to all the light (Plus)
pixel groups. The user must REMEMBER to subtract the 1 or 2 million to
get the actual component number for a given pixel group (e.g., the
number 2,017,154 is really 17,154). </span>
    <ul type="circle">

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Find and
determine the pixel group number containing your target using the xvd
display of the Plus/Minus image. Be prepared to enter this number in
the next step. </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Property
List for"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">,
enter the pixel group number from the previous step, then click the
"Start" button. Various statistics that describe the selected target
pixel group will be displayed in the xterm window. Use these values to
customize and hone the analysis to focus specifically on your target
object's particular spectral and shape characteristics, and all other
pixel groups that are similar. Enter values in the "Spectral Filters"
and "Filters" dialog boxes. Note that these parameters are optional,
and some may not be appropriate or relevant for your particular target.
    </span>
    <ul type="circle">

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">From the
displayed property statistics, enter "Foreground" and "Background"
thresholds in the "Spectral Filters" dialog box. "Foreground" refers to
the target pixel values, and "Background" refers to the (contrasting)
pixel area around the target. The entered minimum and maximum values
should generally be +/- 50 of the spectral mean of your target pixel
group. Values can be entered for both the first and second image, but
filling all the parameters may not be necessary for your target case.
Generally, provide parameters for the First Image Foreground and
Background, then fill in the rest as needed. This process can be
iterated. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Mirroring (on
by default) causes two searches for pixels matching the threshold
criteria. The second search is a mirror image of the first, i.e., the
spectral filter values for the first image and second image are
interchanged, and the results are combined using the "and" logical. </li>

      <li class="MsoNormal" style="">From the
displayed property statistics, enter minimum amd maximum values for the
"Area," "Diameter," and "Area/Diameter Ratio" fields in the "Filters"
dialog box. "Area" controls the number of pixels in the target pixel
group (and subsequent similar target pixel groups to be found).
"Diameter" is for controlling the horizontal and vertical lengths of
the target groups. "A/D Ratio" is for controlling the shape of the
target groups. Not all of these parameters may be relevant to your
target's characteristics, and over specifying them might hinder
detection. </li>

    </ul>

  </li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Filtered
Property List"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;">
then click the "Start" button. This tool will generate statisitics for
all the pixel group polygons in the color change detection image.
However, only the first thirty (30) pixel group statisitics are printed
to the xterm window. This information is provided primarily for
reference purposes. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"None"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> then click the "Start" button.
This step resets all intermediate files and generates a color change
detection image based upon all the selected thresholds and filters. A
color image will display with Red indicating target pixel objects from
Image 1, and blue indicating target pixel objects from image 2. If the
change detection product does not meet your expectations, you can
revisit any of the "Tools" to determine new "Filters" or "Spectral
Filters" parameters. After making any changes, be SURE to click </span><b>"Refilter"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> from the bottom of the RID
dialog box. (Threshold Plus/Minus changes required use of the "Start"
button.) Expect that several iterations may be necessary to obtain
satisfactory results. </span></li>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="">Click <b>"Refilter"</b><span style="font-weight: normal;"> (at the bottom of the RID
dialog box) if any changes are made in <a name="OLE_LINK88"></a><a name="OLE_LINK87"></a>the "Filters" or "Spectral
Filters" parameters (not "Thresholds") as part of an iteration process.
This implements the new changes and generates a new color change
detection display. </span></li>
