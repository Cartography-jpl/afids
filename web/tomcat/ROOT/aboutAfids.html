<h2>About AFIDS</h2>

<p>
The AFIDS (Automated Fusion of Image Data System) software currently
supports the co-registration of multidate satellite imagery. When
multidate imagery is obtained, one of the dates is identified as the
"master," to which all "secondary" dates are registered. The master
scene should be as clear and cloud-free as possible, be a near-nadir
view, and have the best overlapping 'position' with respect to the
secondary scenes, which may be offset due to variations in flight
paths.

The basic co-registration concept begins with an orthorectified 'image
base' (in Platte Caree projection) to provide an approximate
cartographic mapping and projection. The satellite datasets are
initially registered to the 'image base' to obtain its projection
characteristics. Medium resolution satellites use a global
Landsat-based orthorectified image base, and higher resolution
satellites use USGS Digital Ortho Quads (DOQ) or other
sources. Digital elevation models are used to correct perspective
shifts due to spacecraft height and view-angle. Satellite images are
co-registered to the image base using an automated and recursive
series of FFTs (Fast Fourier Transforms) to create a large set of very
accurate tiepoints, which are used to warp the images. NO MANUAL
tiepoints are used. This approach requires multiple sequential
processing steps to warp the dataset by resampling pixel values. To
avoid degradation of the data by multiple resamplings, each warp is
represented by an "Ultra-Fine" grid of tiepoints. For successive
warps, the grids are composed mathematically into a single grid such
that ONLY ONE RESAMPLING occurs. The "Ultra-Fine" grid can currently
contain over four million points (1000x1000 grid recommended),
facilitating very high precision pixel adjustments. A publication
describing the process is available.

AFIDS is built upon the VICAR/IBIS software. VICAR (Video Image
Communication And Retrieval) is a comprehensive command-line image
processing system originally developed in the mid-1960s to support the
Nation's unmanned space exploration program. IBIS (Image-Based
Information System) is a raster-based Geographic Information System
(GIS) developed in the 1970s as a fully integrated subsystem of
VICAR. While both systems have continued to evolve through the years,
it is the IBIS portion that has focused on developing an integrated
and comprehensive set of semi-automated image co-registration software
capabilities. This software set is generally referred to as the "GT"
routines for their integrated use and compatibility with GeoTIFF
georeferencing algorithms.
